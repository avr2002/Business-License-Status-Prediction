    "Many of us have dreams what if I become the founder of a start-up and can lead it to become a big business like Microsoft, or Facebook/Amazon. But again there are many people who cheat people to run their business, probably everyone has heard about cheat-funds. This dataset contains a lot of data and the `LICENSE STATUS` column which depicts whether the person has been able to get a business license or not. Based on the given features you have to predict whether a person will be given a license or not to run his business. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `LICENSE STATUS` contains the following categories:\n",
    "1. **`AAC`** (license was cancelled during term) \n",
    "2. **`AAI`** (license was issued) \n",
    "3. **`INQ`** (license requires inquiry) \n",
    "4. **`REA`** (license revocation has been appealed) \n",
    "5. **`REV`** (license was revoked)\n",
